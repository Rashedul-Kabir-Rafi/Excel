This repository is a growing collection of my Excel projects and practice files — focused on building strong foundations for data analytics and business analytics.

Excel is still one of the most powerful tools for quick data exploration, reporting, and analysis. I'm using this space to document what I learn, from lookup functions to dynamic dashboards and beyond.

While Excel is just the beginning, this repo supports my broader learning path — which includes Python, SQL, and machine learning — all aimed at solving real-world business problems with data.
